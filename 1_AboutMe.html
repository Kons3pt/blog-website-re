                        <h1>About Me </h1>
                    <p>
                        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                        My name is Caden, known username is Konsept<br><br>
                        I am a (former)Highschool student working to self-teach myself in many subjects that I would like to get better at.
                        At the moment this consists of Coding, Video Game Design, World Building, language learning, and Digital Art.<br><br>
                        To find why I want to improve at these things, how I found them in the first place, and
                        how I work to improve on a more technical level, please go to your prefered project on the right side bar.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Initial information</h2>
                    <p>
                        I plan on doing multiple different types of recordings, it will mostly be simple typing documentation like this but
                        I might do different forms of communication later on. This could be audio recordings in the moment, video recordings, visual presentations, etc.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Why Make A Website?</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are two main reasons for this.  The first is that I
                        want to record my progress, which is including times when I get stuck or dont want to do it anymore, to when I
                        can get everything done instantly and learn it immediately. I do this because I believe that going back and thinking 
                        about my thought process in the current moment will further my understanding of the subject I am learning about. 
                        I also just believe in recording everything I do for later review. 
                        <br><br>
                        The second thing is that I want other people, friends, family, peers, and possible employers, to be able to see my
                        thought process and workflow in a casual tone through writing or any other form of communication.
                        <br><br>
                        I also made this website with the intention to use it as a portfolio for projects, completed, currently in progress, 
                        and even projects that havent left the whiteboard
                    </p>
                    <h2>How do I teach myself?</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are multiple levels to this topic. First is that I am mainly self taught in these subjects and simply use Youtube or a video equivalent to learn.
                        The two exceptions to this are for coding, I have some experience learning from teachers in school. I also have a structured program for digital art
                        from a professional but I do not have communication with him so I still consider it self-learning.
                        <br><br>
                        The main way I prefer to learn is using the "First Principle", which is an way of thinking where you break down anything you are learning or working on into 
                        its very core parts and then learning from the ground up to fully understand the subject at hand.
                        <br><br>
