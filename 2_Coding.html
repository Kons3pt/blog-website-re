                        <h1>Coding</h1><br>
                        <h2>Why?</h2>
                        I first got into coding from online school, doing simple python coding. I then went on to begin expanding into web design
                        and game design to supplement my coding process and my creativity.<br><br>

                        I like coding because it is a good exercise for my brain and it is very versatile. I like to think of it as a substitute for math in problem solving.

                        I enjoy the challenge and the certainty that the challenge can be overcome with critical thinking.

                
                        <h2>Materials</h2>
                        I use VS code for code editing and github for server storage.
                        <h2>Additional information</h2>

                        I currently have a good grasp on Python, C#, HTML, and CSS. I am working to learn about java script and SQL. 
                        I use python, html, css, java script, and sql for web design and C# for game design.<br><br>
                        
                        I can  apply coding to a large amount of different subjects outside of coding itself, almost any subject has some code to help supplement it.<br><br>


                         I also consider that this is an essential skill for a large amount of processes and I believe that it will come in hand in the future.<br><br>

                        I decided to make this website from scratch and learn how everything works
                        instead of just using a template an only understanding part of it or none of it at all, which is a problem of abstraction. <br><br>The definition of abstraction I am using in this text is
                         "is the process of taking away or removing characteristics from something in order to reduce it to a set of essential characteristics", which is used in programming but also applies
                        to the real world, the same concept would be "black box usage". Where you do not need to be able to completely understand something to be able to use it, for instance, you can use
                        your phone without knowing how to read java or make a circuit. This is generally a good thing for using tools, but it has become a problem when it comes to learning because it becomes 
                        significantly easier to just use the tool and have a lower level of understanding instead of actually learning how it works, this is also why I talk about the "first principle".
